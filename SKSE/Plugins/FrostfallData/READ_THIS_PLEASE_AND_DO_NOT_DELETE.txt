Frostfall Data Files
====================

The purpose of the files in Skyrim/Data/SKSE/Plugins/FrostfallData are to store Frostfall's Settings Profile data. These files are created and are required in order for Frostfall to run.

Please DO NOT delete the files created in this directory, or all of your mod settings for Frostfall will be reset.
